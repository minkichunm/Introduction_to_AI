# Introduction_to_AI

1) Include all files in the same package:
ChineseChecker.java
AI.java
ValidMovesCalculator.java
WinCalculator.java
AIStatus.java
Move.java
Board.java


2) Run ChineseChecker.java

Note: A* is a better performing AI. Feel free to experiment with the different buttons.
When you play two AI's against each other, click on the board. 
When you have a orange piece but you want to switch to any AI, you should move that piece first.
